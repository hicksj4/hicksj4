## Interest in Software Engineering and What I Hope To Come

Like probably many other CS students, I was drawn to the computer at a young age. Why? For video games of course. I've always been interested in tech-adjacent things and when I was younger it was hard to get me off the computer. It only felt right to major in computer science, as I wasn't very interested in much else. I think one of my primary motivations and skills I want to learn in my CS journey is game development skills. Of course, because I'm always online you do always hear the "Don't be game developer." saying on forums online. It seems discouraging, but it makes sense if you pay attention to the industry. The gaming industry can be very low paying, at least compared to Fortune 500 companies, and volitile. If your game, which you poured years of effort into isn't a success financially, well, it's tough luck for you as a developer. However, you do hear about those remarkable stories of indie developers/solo developers who create a game all on their own with no company backing and create a success. The picture I attached is the solo developer of Stardew Valley, one of the most successful games of all time.

## Keeping An Open Mind

But I believe going to school for CS should be exclusively focused on your own interests, if I felt that I would have just gone to a game development bootcamp or something. I think it's important to experience all aspects of the CS curriculum to see maybe that there are other topics about the field that you may be interested in. For example, in this course I'm writing this essay for, Software Engineering, we are learning Javascript and will be creating our own application for the final project. So far, I find Javascript and working on more of the front-end side of software engineering enjoyable and maybe this will interest me more than game development in the future. At worst I could at least the knowledge I gain form this course to synergize with my other projects. 

## Making Connections and Finding Like-Minded Peers and Conclusion

Another important and probably underrated aspect of going to university for CS, is that you can make connections will people who share your own interests. It's much harder in a university setting to find your particular niche of community you want to participate in which is valuable. I hope that during my time in university I'll be able to connect more with people that are interested in similar topics and maybe you could even find someone to work with, or at worst you meet someone who knows someone else you could connect to.

Overall, I'm excited to learn as much as I can from my CS journey through university. I also hope to apply these skills I learn in my classes to apply to my own projects and to carry into my career.
