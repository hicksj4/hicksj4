## UI Frameworks; Well-Designed Websites And Their Benefits

UI frameworks such as Bootstrap, as we've been learning in class, have become one of the standards of implementation in regards to front-end frameworks and web development. But why is it that it became so popular? I believe what the creators of Bootstrap sought to achieve was a cohesiveness between design and tech in regards to websites. This idealogy of creating more user-friendly interfaces for front-end seems like a somewhat more modern idea, especially if you've been using the internet > 10 years. The reasons why I believe this was a step in right direction for the internet as a whole, can connect back to my previous essay about tidy code. When you have an easily understandable, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing website, it becomes much easier for the user to use. This idea of ease of use for the user is good for numerous reasons, but the main ones that can be seen as tangible results is that, in my opinion, one, that a better designed website will increase the chances a user engages with the website, whether that be participating in the forums or purchasing something. My second reason, one that I've felt had been overlooked as a kid on the internet, is that it makes it much easier for non-tech literate people to participate as well. I believe especially with reason 2 is why the internet is as popular/incredibly widespread as it it.

## The Transition From Old To New

The above photo shows a somewhat recent picture of Yahoo Japan's front page. You may look at this and say "Wow, it feels like this is 15 years old!" and you may be right, it may be. Although Japan's web development has seen improvements, it wasn't until maybe in the last few years that Japan seemed to have transitioned on to using more modern UI frameworks like Bootstrap. If you want to learn about there are numerous articles regarding this topic that are fascinating to read, but it's interesting to see a country that feels generally 'futuristic' have such a dated view in regards to webpages (and Fax machines, I believe those are still used everywhere in Japan). However, the point I'm generally try to make here is, when you look at this Yahoo JP page, there is a sense of chaos to it. It isn't like the simple, soft and rounded Airbnb page photo I put at the top of this essay. I would be inclined to believe that most people (barring the fact the page is in Japanese language) prefer the design of Airbnb's website and would find it easier to engage in the product of their website.

## Style And Design Matter

I believe that UI frameworks such as Bootstrap are a very worthwhile topic to learn, especially if you decide to focus on front-end development in your career. I also find front-end such a fascinating field because it combines an idea of design and tech in the same concept. What may attract one person to what website may repel another person from that website. The transition, especially if you have been on the internet before 2010, has been incredible to watch to say the least. To see the transition from being on AIM messenger on AOL to the insane messaging techniques that are available to you on iPhones is very fascinating to me. I'm truly curious as to how front-end development will evolve in the next decade.
