## A Reflection On Beginning To Learn Javascript

Beginning to learn to a new language, or even any technology is a must to keep up with the rapidly developing tech that goes on behind the software engineering world. Luckily, if you have a generally good grasp on at least on language, it is somewhat widely agreed that the transition to a new language won't be as difficult. I've just begun to learn Javascript for the Software Engineering course I am taking in university and it's been fairly smooth. It was good practice to do many of the basic Javascript exercises available on FreeCodeCamp, a lot of coding concepts I learned in previous classes translated well into my understanding of Javascript. There were some different traits that I had to get used to, but I see the benefit in doing it this way, primarily when you create a object with properties. I'm used to Java where you must declare the type of each property in the object, whereas in Javascript you don't have to do that, due to type coercion.

## The Difficulties Of A New Language

However, it wasn't a complete refresher that I could understand easily. After the "Basic Javascript" course, the next lessons were on ES6 Javascript, which was released in 2015 and added many new features to the language. This is where things got a bit dicey for me and I will definitely need to study and brush up on the concepts presented in this part of the language. Most topics covered were slightly difficult, but with some staring at the code and lesson for awhile I could figure it out. It was interesting to see that ES6 introduced a Class keyword just like Java. Where I got really caught up on and will need to study a bit more is the "Destructuring Assignment" portion of Javascript. For some reason, and honestly looking back on it maybe it wasn't that hard, but during those exercises I was stumped. Something about the syntax of what you are doing with the destructuring was confusing to me and was such a departure from what I'm used to seeing syntax wise.

## Finding Some Extra Help Online

Thankfully, with some searching here and there. I found a Reddit thread of someone having my same plight in understanding destructuring and someone replied with a great answer that helped me wrap my head around it a bit more. Here are some excerpts from his comment, excluding the code that helped me conceptually understand the benefit of destructuring. "In order to understand what destructuring is, consider that JavaScript has two kinds of operations that are opposites:"

    You can construct compound data, for example, by setting properties and via object literals.

    You can extract data out of compound data, for example, by getting properties.

"Destructuring patterns are syntactically similar to the literals that are used for multivalue construction. But they appear where data is received (e.g., at the left-hand side of assignments), not where data is created (e.g., at the right-hand side of assignments)."

## Conclusion

Learning a new language/technology is almost always beneficial in this field. At worst, even if you don't use the technology that much, it can at least help you think in a different way and allow you to see different perspectives on programming/coding that hopefully can be benefical to not only your career, but your own understanding of programming. Hopefully my Javascript journey will continue and improve from here.
