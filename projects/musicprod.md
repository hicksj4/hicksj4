I made a remix of an Ariana Grande song in the beginning of my music production journey. The production, mixing, and mastering was all done by myself in the Ableton Digital Audio Workstataion software. I was inspired by the early EDM scene that was popular in this area of time, primarily with vocal "chopping" that is a primary highlight of the song. It's been so long I don't remember the particular instruments I had used for the song but I believed it was mainly the Massive VST and the Izotope software for mastering. Elsewhere on my SoundCloud you can see other songs I have left up as well. If you are a creative type, you can understand it is somewhat embarassing looking back at your old work, but I am still somewhat proud one got some popularity!"

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
