A link one of my most popular songs[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/buuudis/onelasttime?si=88e7a246605e424d9b89ef61a6ac9b64&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing).

Early when I was learning music production, I made a remix of an Ariana Grande song. The production, mixing, and mastering was all done by myself in the Ableton Digital Audio Workstataion software. I was inspired by the early EDM scene that was popular in this area of time, primarily with vocal "chopping" that is a primary highlight of the song. It's been so long I don't remember the particular instruments I had used for the song but I believed it was mainly the Massive VST and the Izotope software for mastering. Elsewhere on my SoundCloud you can see other songs I have left up as well. If you are a creative type, you can understand it is somewhat embarassing looking back at your old work, but I am still somewhat proud one got some popularity!"
