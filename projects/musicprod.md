This project involved music production as a personal hobby. Over the years, I've composed, mixed, and mastered a wide range of original songs using the digital audio workstation Ableton. My work covers a variety of musical elements, including synth work, drums, and guitar compositions, allowing me to experiment and refine my skills across different genres. My creative efforts led to some notable achievements, such as two songs gaining over 100k plays and another going viral on TikTok with over 200k plays. Although my primary focus was personal enjoyment and creative exploration, the experience provided me with a deep understanding of music production processes and the satisfaction of trying to attempt to create polished, professional-sounding tracks.

I was solely responsible for all aspects of the music production process. This included writing and arranging the compositions, programming and playing instruments, as well as mixing and mastering the final tracks. I handled every detail of the production, from sound design and synth work to drum programming and guitar performance. I utilized industry-standard tools such as Izotope Ozone for mastering and Fabfilter VSTs for mixing to enhance the quality of my work.

Through years of producing music independently, I gained valuable insights into the technical and creative aspects of audio engineering. I learned how to approach creating music that attempts to approach professional quality by understanding essential mixing concepts such as equalizing, compression, saturation, and other techniques. My ability to analyze and understand techniques used by modern producers in popular music significantly improved, enabling me to identify production styles and methods with greater clarity. This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the artistry and meticulous effort that goes into producing music at a high level.

For anonymity I included a screenshot of the statistics Spotify reports to you on your stream count for your music in the image above.
