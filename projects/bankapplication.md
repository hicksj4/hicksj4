As a hobby I've written music for multiple years now. I almost entirely work in the digital audio workstation Ableton, where I compose, mix, and master original music. Over the years, I have created many full songs, handling everything from synth work to drums and guitar compositions. My expertise extends to using industry-standard tools like Izotope Ozone for mixing and mastering and Fabfilter VSTs for precise mixing, ensuring high-quality production values in every track.

I have achieved notable success with my work, including two tracks that garnered over 100k plays and one that went viral on TikTok, accumulating over 200k plays. While music production is a personal hobby, it has provided me with a deep understanding of audio engineering, sound design, and creative composition, showcasing my ability to create engaging and widely appreciated music. For the sake of anonymity, I won't share the songs specifically but will show a screenshot from Spotify's reported statistics they send artists.
