For my ICS 311 final paper, I delved into the deeper workings of the engine utilized in id Software's game Doom (1993). The focus is on id Software’s pioneering role in pushing the technological boundaries of video game graphics, particularly within the first-person shooter genre. The analysis begins with Doom (1993), highlighting its use of Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) trees to optimize graphics rendering on the limited hardware of the time. Doom’s graphical innovation stemmed from the need to improve upon the costly ray-casting technique used in its predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D. By employing BSP trees, Doom efficiently managed hidden-surface determination, rendering only the visible parts of a game level to reduce the computational load on the CPU. This technique allowed Doom to achieve smoother and more immersive gameplay, setting a new standard for performance in video games. The transition from Doom to Quake (1996) marks an evolution from 2.5D to true 3D rendering, with Quake building upon the BSP tree structure by introducing Potential Visible Set (PVS) calculations.
