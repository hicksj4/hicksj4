A link to my [eBay Store](https://www.ebay.com/usr/thabigcat808).

When the collectible boom happened during the 2020 covid year, I became interested in collectibles as my old sports and Pokemon cards had gained massive value. I had decided to try my hand out at selling cards online and found it fun and somewhat relaxing. Over the past few years I've bought collections from friends and others to sell them. I find it interesting to see how the market evolves in regards to sports cards and TCG (trading card game) cards and the factors that affect their values/demand. I'm not as dedicated to it as I was back in 2020/2021, but I still follow it, generally searching for opportunities to turn a profit on a collectible.
