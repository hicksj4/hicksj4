I always found video editing and directing videos enjoyable as a hobby. I've since stopped, but still think about starting again, especially in the context of maybe making a music video for my music. This is a link to a video I editing a few years ago using DaVinci Resolve software. My goal for the video was to make it look like an 'older' vintage type of video. I've always enjoyed those older videos of Super 8 film taken in the 70's and 80's. My skills are pretty amateur, but it's fun to mess around in the software every once and awhile. It's impressive to me how good people can get at this! I believe actual Hollywood movies are edited within the Resolve software which is amazing to me.
